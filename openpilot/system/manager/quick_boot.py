"""Whether the tree is fit to skip build.py on the next boot.

launch_chffrplus.sh runs build.py only when `prebuilt` is absent, so that
marker is an instruction ("do not rebuild"), not a record ("build finished").
Writing it while the tree holds missing or cross-built native artifacts pins
the device to exactly that state: nothing rebuilds them, and
stale artifacts would stay pinned until a source-only release rebuilds them.

A container-built pandad reached a car this way. common/hardware/hw.h selects
paths at compile time and SConstruct defines __COMMA_HARDWARE__ only when the
BUILD machine has /AGNOS, so the container build baked in
Path::comma_home() -- it read $HOME/.comma/params while card wrote
/data/params. The OBD multiplexing handshake never completed, CarParams was
never published, and the screen sat at "sunnypilot unavailable, waiting to
start".

Kept free of openpilot.common.params so it imports without the native params
library (and is therefore testable off-device).
