"""Tinygrad revision (pin) compatibility between the device tree and model pkls.

A driving pkl embeds tinygrad JIT kernels compiled against one specific
tinygrad revision. Running a pkl under a different revision crashes modeld
(the 2026-09-20 pin bump shipped e837-built pkls that died on the 0811 tree).

Producers publish a catalog-level ``tinygrad_ref`` and the model manager
copies it into a ``<pkl>.tinygrad_pin`` sidecar at download time. Consumers
check the sidecar before loading: unknown (no sidecar) keeps the legacy load
attempt, a mismatch falls back to the built-in model instead of taking
modeld down.
